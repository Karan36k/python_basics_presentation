    "\n",
    "### Install\n",
    "\n",
    "Python runs on windows, linux, mac, and other environments. There are many python distributions available. However, the recommended way to install python under Microsoft Windows or Linux is to use the Anaconda distribution available at https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows. If you are installing python from elsewhere, make sure you get at least Python *3.8* version, not 2.7. The Anaconda distribution comes with the SciPy collection of scientific python tools as well as the iron python notebook. For developing python code without notebooks, consider using spyder (also included with Anaconda) or your favorite IDE under windows, mac, etc. (e.g. Visual Studio Code which handles both plain python programs and notebooks).\n",

    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the “Anaconda” installer.\n",
